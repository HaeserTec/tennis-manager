# Intermediate Tennis Drills

## Overview
These drills are tailored for intermediate players who have mastered basic strokes and are ready to incorporate strategy, consistency, and tactical play. The focus is on refining techniques while simulating real match situations.

## Equipment Needed
- Tennis racket
- Tennis balls
- Access to a full tennis court
- Cones or markers for movement drills
- Water bottle and towel

## Warm-up (10-15 minutes)
- Dynamic stretches (leg swings, arm swings)
- Shadow swings practicing forehand and backhand
- Light rallying with a partner

## Main Drills

### 1. Approach Shots and Volleys
- Practice hitting approach shots to move forward
- Transition to net with volleys
- Focus on depth control and net clearance
- Work on both forehand and backhand volleys

### 2. Movement and Footwork Drills
- Split-step timing exercises
- Directional hitting while moving laterally
- Recovery drills after shots
- Ladder drills for agility

### 3. Rally with Spin and Placement
- Incorporate topspin and slice

### 4. Conditional Drills
- Down-the-line attacks: Hit winners down the line
- Crosscourt defenses: Defend against aggressive shots
- Point play simulations: Mini-games with specific conditions

## Key Principles
- Blend technique refinement with situational point play (approach shots, volleys).
- Introduce movement drills that link split-step timing with directional hitting.
- Encourage rallying with depth control, spin variation, and strategic placement.
- Include condition-based drills (e.g., down-the-line attacks, crosscourt defenses) with outcome notes.

## Tips for Intermediate Players
- Analyze your shots and adjust based on outcomes
- Practice under pressure to simulate matches
- Work on mental focus and decision-making
- Incorporate rest days to avoid overuse injuries

## Progress Tracking
- Note rally lengths, shot accuracy, and tactical decisions
- Track win rates in conditional drills
- Record video for self-analysis
- Set goals for consistency and strategy

## Cool-down
- Static stretching
- Review key learnings
- Discuss strategies for upcoming matches
