## Assignment Process
1. **Initial Assessment**: Observe player in a casual hitting session.
2. **Skill Testing**: Use the assessment tests above.
3. **Age Consideration**: Check if age aligns with recommended range.
4. **Coach Discussion**: Involve parent/guardian input if needed.
5. **Placement**: Assign to the most appropriate level; err on the side of caution for safety.
6. **Trial Period**: Allow 1-2 sessions to confirm fit, with option to adjust.

## Special Considerations
- **Younger Advanced Players**: If an 8-10 year old shows advanced skills, consider private coaching or modified advanced drills.
- **Older Beginners**: Adults or teens with no experience start in Beginner regardless of age.
- **Physical Limitations**: Adjust based on health, coordination, or developmental factors.
- **Motivation**: Consider enthusiasm and willingness to learn alongside skills.

For questions or adjustments, consult with the head coach.
